 Differences between Document and Window Objects :

In this article, we will see the  Differences between Document object & Window object

DOCUMENT OBJECTS ?
* JavaScript Document object is an object that provides access to all HTML    elements of a document. 
* When an HTML document is loaded into a browser window, then it becomes a document object.
* The document object stores the elements of an HTML document, such as HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags as objects.
* A document object is a child object of the Window object, which refers to the browser.

WINDOW OBJECTS ?
* The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
* All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
*Global variables are properties of the window object.
*Global functions are methods of the window object.

          web page that is loaded in the browser.

        * All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
        * The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)                            
      syntax :
